A file download manager is a computer program dedicated to the task of downloading possibly
unrelated stand-alone files from the Internet for storage. The typical file download manager
at a minimum provides means to recover from errors without losing the work already completed,
and can optionally split the file to be downloaded into two or more segments, which are
then moved in parallel, potentially making the process faster within the limits of the available
bandwidth.
Download managers are useful for very active Internet users. For dial-up users, they can
automatically dial the Internet Service Provider at night, when rates or tariffs are usually much
lower, download the specified files, and hang-up. They can record which links the user clicks
on during the day, and queue these files for later download.
